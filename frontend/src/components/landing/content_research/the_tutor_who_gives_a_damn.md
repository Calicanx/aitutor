You know the drill. Raise your hand in a class of 35 kids - maybe the teacher notices, maybe they don't. Ask ChatGPT for help - it spits out an answer and immediately forgets you existed. Hire an expensive tutor - they're great for that one hour a week, but good luck getting help at 10 PM when you're actually doing homework.

Here's the thing: **learning isn't one-size-fits-all, and neither should teaching be.**

You deserve someone who remembers that you struggle with fractions but crush geometry. Someone who knows you're a night owl who thinks better after dinner. Someone who notices when you're frustrated and knows exactly how to get you back on track.

You deserve a tutor who actually gives a damn.

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**"Like having a brilliant teacher in your pocket who's obsessed with YOUR success"**

### Feature 1: It Actually Knows You
**Icon Suggestion:** Brain/Memory icon

**Headline:** "Remembers Everything (In a Non-Creepy Way)"

**Copy:**
Mentioned last week that word problems confuse you? It remembers. Figured out that sports analogies help concepts click for you? It remembers. Starting to get rusty on quadratic equations you learned two months ago? It noticed before you did.

Unlike every other AI tool that treats each conversation like meeting you for the first time, Teachr.live builds an actual relationship with you. It learns your strengths, your weaknesses, what makes you laugh, when you need encouragement, and how your brain likes to process information.

It's like if your best teacher kept detailed notes on YOU specifically, then used them to make every single lesson perfectly tailored.

### Feature 2: Guides, Never Tells
**Icon Suggestion:** Compass/Path icon

**Headline:** "No Answer-Spewing Allowed"

**Copy:**
Here's what we DON'T do: give you the answer so you can copy it down and learn absolutely nothing.

Here's what we DO: break down problems into steps, ask you guiding questions, help you think through the logic, and celebrate when YOU figure it out yourself.

Think of it like learning to ride a bike. We're running alongside you, hand on the seat, ready to catch you if you wobble - but we're not just carrying you to the finish line. Because when you get there on your own? That feeling is everything.

The Socratic method isn't new. We just made it actually work in 2025.

### Feature 3: Sees & Hears Everything
**Icon Suggestion:** Eye/Camera icon

**Headline:** "Shows Your Work? We Can Literally See It"

**Copy:**
Stuck on a problem? Don't try to describe it - just show us. Hold it up to your camera. Share your screen. We can see your work, spot exactly where you went wrong, and guide you back on track.

Plus, we can actually TALK to you. Because sometimes you need to hear "you've got this" out loud, not read it in a chat box.

It's the closest thing to having a real tutor sitting next to you, without them actually being in your room (which, let's be honest, would be weird).

### Feature 4: Emotional Intelligence
**Icon Suggestion:** Heart/Pulse icon

**Headline:** "Knows When You're About to Rage-Quit"

**Copy:**
Getting the same problem wrong for the fourth time? We feel the frustration building. Been grinding for 90 minutes straight? We know you need a break. Crushed a concept you were scared of? We're genuinely proud of you.

This isn't some algorithm pretending to care. It's AI that actually picks up on your emotional state and responds like a human would - with empathy, encouragement, or a well-timed joke to break the tension.

Because here's a secret: **how you FEEL about learning affects how well you learn.** And we actually care about both.

### Feature 5: Your Personal Resource Hunter
**Icon Suggestion:** Target/Bullseye icon

**Headline:** "Finds THE Video You Need (Not 10 Random Ones)"

**Copy:**
You know that thing where you don't understand something, so you go to YouTube and watch seven different videos before finding one that actually makes sense? Yeah, we hate that too.

When you're stuck on a concept, Teachr.live finds the PERFECT explainer video for your specific confusion - not just "quadratic equations," but "why completing the square actually works when you're a visual learner who hates memorizing formulas."

It's like having a friend who's already watched every educational video on the internet and knows exactly which one will make it click for YOUR brain.

### Feature 6: Adaptive Learning Path
**Icon Suggestion:** Winding road/Journey icon

**Headline:** "Your Journey, Your Pace, Zero Judgment"

**Copy:**
Some days you're on fire and blow through three topics. Some days you need to spend 45 minutes on one problem and that's totally fine.

Your learning path evolves constantly based on where you are RIGHT NOW. Need to revisit something from last month? It'll weave it in naturally. Ready to jump ahead? Let's go. Forgot something important? It notices and adds a refresher before it becomes a problem.

This is the opposite of standardized education. This is learning that bends to fit YOU, not the other way around.

## FAQ Section

**Q: Is this just ChatGPT for homework?**
A: Hell no. ChatGPT gives you answers and forgets you exist. We guide you to find answers yourself, remember everything about your learning journey, see your work through your camera, talk to you with actual voice, and build a real relationship with you over time. Completely different beast.

**Q: Will it just do my homework for me?**
A: Nope. We're the tutor equivalent of teaching you to fish rather than handing you a fish. We'll guide you step-by-step, ask leading questions, and help you understand - but you're doing the work. Because that's how you actually learn.

**Q: How does it remember things about me?**
A: Every interaction builds your learning profile - what you struggle with, what clicks for you, your preferred learning style, topics you've mastered, areas that need review. It's like how a great teacher keeps mental notes on each student, except ours are actually perfect and comprehensive.

**Q: What if I'm really behind in my class?**
A: Perfect. We meet you exactly where you are with zero judgment. Need to go back to basics? Let's do it. Need to fill in gaps from two years ago? We've got time. Your pace is the right pace.

**Q: Can my parents see my progress?**
A: We can build that feature if needed! Right now it's focused on YOU and your learning, but parent dashboards are totally doable.

**Q: Does it work on my phone?**
A: Yep! Desktop, laptop, tablet, phone - wherever you learn, we're there.

**Q: What if I'm stuck at 2 AM and need help?**
A: That's literally the perfect time to use us. We don't sleep, we don't have office hours, and we're never too tired to help. 2 AM panic session? We're ready.

**Q: How is this different from Khan Academy or other learning apps?**
A: Khan Academy is amazing for video lessons. We're for when you need a TUTOR - someone who knows YOU, adapts to YOUR needs in real-time, sees YOUR specific work, and guides YOU through YOUR specific confusion. It's personalized in a way pre-recorded content can never be.

# DESIGN PROMPT: 

when you're designing this page, i also want you to think of where you want to add images and what kind of images you want to add (in the alt text, write what kind of image you want there, and also put dummy images there).....same for app screenshots, think about where you want to add app screenshots and app animated gifs and in the alt text say what you want that screenshot / animated gif to demonstrate.

<role>
You are an expert frontend engineer, UI/UX designer, visual design specialist, and typography expert. Your goal is to help the user integrate a design system into an existing codebase in a way that is visually consistent, maintainable, and idiomatic to their tech stack.

Before proposing or writing any code, first build a clear mental model of the current system:
- Identify the tech stack (e.g. React, Next.js, Vue, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, etc.).
- Understand the existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows), global styles, and utility patterns.
- Review the current component architecture (atoms/molecules/organisms, layout primitives, etc.) and naming conventions.
- Note any constraints (legacy CSS, design library in use, performance or bundle-size considerations).

Ask the user focused questions to understand the user's goals. Do they want:
- a specific component or page redesigned in the new style,
- existing components refactored to the new system, or
- new pages/features built entirely in the new style?

Once you understand the context and scope, do the following:
- Propose a concise implementation plan that follows best practices, prioritizing:
  - centralizing design tokens,
  - reusability and composability of components,
  - minimizing duplication and one-off styles,
  - long-term maintainability and clear naming.
- When writing code, match the user’s existing patterns (folder structure, naming, styling approach, and component patterns).
- Explain your reasoning briefly as you go, so the user understands *why* you’re making certain architectural or design choices.

Always aim to:
- Preserve or improve accessibility.
- Maintain visual consistency with the provided design system.
- Leave the codebase in a cleaner, more coherent state than you found it.
- Ensure layouts are responsive and usable across devices.
- Make deliberate, creative design choices (layout, motion, interaction details, and typography) that express the design system’s personality instead of producing a generic or boilerplate UI.

# Design Style: Neo-brutalism

## Design Philosophy

**Neo-brutalism (or Neu-Brutalism)** is the digital punk rebellion against the "Corporate Memphis" and polished "Clean SaaS" aesthetics that dominated the 2010s. While traditional Brutalism (architecture/early web) was utilitarian and drab, **Neo-brutalism** is vibrant, performative, and intentionally distinct. It combines the raw, unrefined structural honesty of brutalism with the high-saturation energy of Pop Art, the "sticker" culture of the early internet, and the rebellious spirit of DIY zine design.

**Core DNA & Fundamental Principles:**

1.  **Unapologetic Visibility (The Anti-Subtle)**: Modern design often tries to be invisible—borderless cards floating on gradients, soft shadows that barely exist, blur effects that obscure structure. Neo-brutalism rejects this entirely. It demands to be seen. Structure is not implied; it is **enforced with thick, hard-edged black lines** (`border-4` everywhere). Shadows are not simulated light diffusion; they are **solid blocks of ink** offset at 45-degree angles (8px, 12px, 16px offsets with zero blur). Every element has **visual weight and presence**.

2.  **Digital Tactility (The Sticker Effect)**: The screen is treated not as a fluid glass surface, but as a **collage board or bulletin board**. Elements feel like physical stickers, paper cutouts, or printed cards layered on top of each other. They have "physicality"—buttons **press down mechanically** (translate X and Y to cover their shadow), cards **lift up physically** (translate up while shadow grows), and text blocks are **rotated like stickers slapped on at angles** (`rotate-1`, `-rotate-2`). This creates a tangible, almost sculptural interface.

3.  **Organized Chaos (Controlled Messiness)**: The design embraces a "planned messiness" that looks spontaneous but is carefully orchestrated. We use **slight rotations** (`-rotate-2`, `rotate-1`, `rotate-3`) on containers and text to break the monotony of the grid. Elements **overlap intentionally** (floating decorative shapes, badges positioned absolutely). **Asymmetry is encouraged**—headlines split across lines with different colors and rotations, layouts favor 60/40 splits over perfect 50/50. Yet the underlying structure remains **rigid and functional** to ensure usability. It is "ugly-cool"—ugly by traditional polished standards, cool by rebellious intention.

4.  **Default & Raw (Web 1.0 Homage)**: The aesthetic celebrates the "default" look of the web before CSS3 smoothed everything out. It uses **pure black** (`#000000`) for all borders and text—no subtle grays. It uses **high-saturation primary colors** (Hot Red `#FF6B6B`, Vivid Yellow `#FFD93D`, Soft Violet `#C4B5FD`) that feel like unmixed paint or highlighter markers. Typography is **bold and heavy** (font weights 700 and 900 only). The **cream background** (`#FFFDF5`) mimics aged paper or newsprint, rejecting stark white.

5.  **Maximalism as Statement**: While modern design trends toward minimalism, neo-brutalism is **deliberately maximal**. More borders. More shadows. More uppercase text. More visual noise (halftone patterns, grid overlays, noise textures). This isn't visual clutter—it's **visual density** used to create energy and urgency.

6.  **Irony & Confidence**: The style exudes a sense of irony and self-awareness. It says, "I know this looks unpolished, and that's exactly why it's good." It requires **confidence** to pull off; there is no room for timidity in Neo-brutalism. It's anti-corporate, anti-smooth, anti-boring.

7.  **Mechanical Interactivity**: Interactions feel **mechanical and satisfying**, not smooth and ethereal. Buttons don't fade or glow—they **click down** like physical switches. Hovers don't soften—they **snap** into place. Transitions are **fast** (`duration-100`, `duration-200`) and **direct**, creating a snappy, arcade-game-like responsiveness.

**The Vibe & Emotional Tone**:
*   **Nostalgic & Retro-Modern**: Channelling Y2K energy, 90s punk zines, DIY flyers, rave posters, and early web forums.
*   **Energetic & Loud**: It **screams** rather than whispers. It grabs attention aggressively.
*   **Playful yet Functional**: It uses **gamified interactions** (bouncy hovers, hard clicks, rotating badges) to make utilitarian software feel like a toy or game.
*   **Anti-Corporate Authenticity**: It rejects the polished veneer of corporate design systems, embracing rawness and imperfection as honesty.
*   **Confident & Bold**: Every design choice is **deliberate and exaggerated**. Nothing is subtle.

**Visual Signatures (What Makes It Instantly Recognizable)**:
*   **Hard Black Strokes**: The unifying visual element. **If it doesn't have a border, it doesn't exist.** `border-4` is the default. All borders are solid black.
*   **Offset Hard Shadows**: Shadows are **solid rectangles** with zero blur, offset at 45-degree angles (bottom-right). Small: `4px 4px 0px 0px #000`. Medium: `8px 8px 0px 0px #000`. Large: `12px 12px 0px 0px #000`. Massive: `16px 16px 0px 0px #000`.
*   **The "Pop" Palette**: Cream background (`#FFFDF5`) serves as a neutral canvas for **intense bursts of highlighter colors** (Red, Yellow, Violet). Black is the structural color. White is used for contrast panels.
*   **Typography as Texture**: Massive, heavy fonts (**Space Grotesk at 900 weight**) often treated with text outlines (`-webkit-text-stroke: 2px black` with transparent fill) or highlighted by placing text inside bordered, colored boxes. **All caps** for emphasis. Extreme tracking (`tracking-tighter` for headlines, `tracking-widest` for labels).
*   **Sticker Layering**: Text blocks, badges, and containers are **rotated and layered** like stickers on a laptop. Elements cast hard shadows onto elements "below" them.
*   **Texture & Patterns**: Backgrounds aren't flat. Use **halftone dots** (radial gradients), **grid patterns** (linear gradient lines), **noise textures** (SVG filters), and **geometric overlays** to add visual richness without traditional depth.
*   **Asymmetric Composition**: Deliberately **break the grid**. Headlines split unevenly. Sections use 60/40 or 70/30 splits. Elements float off-axis.

**What Neo-Brutalism Is NOT**:
*   **Not Minimal**: It's maximal and dense.
*   **Not Smooth**: It's jagged, sharp, and angular.
*   **Not Subtle**: It's loud, high-contrast, and in-your-face.
*   **Not Polished**: It celebrates roughness and rawness.
*   **Not Corporate**: It's rebellious and anti-establishment in its aesthetic DNA.

## Design Token System (The DNA)

### Colors (High Saturation Light Mode Palette)
Neo-brutalism uses a **single, definitive light mode palette**. All colors are high-saturation and unapologetic.

*   **Background (Canvas)**: `#FFFDF5` (Cream/Off-White)
    *   A warm, paper-like background that mimics aged newsprint or recycled paper. Softer than stark white, more authentic.
    *   Use: Main page background, card interiors, contrast panels.

*   **Foreground (Ink)**: `#000000` (Pure Black)
    *   The structural color. Used for ALL text, ALL borders, ALL shadows. No grays, no variations.
    *   Use: Text, borders (`border-black`), shadows, icons.

*   **Accent (Hot Red)**: `#FF6B6B`
    *   Primary action color. Vibrant, energetic, attention-grabbing.
    *   Use: Primary buttons (`bg-neo-accent`), hover states, important badges, call-to-action backgrounds.

*   **Secondary (Vivid Yellow)**: `#FFD93D`
    *   Secondary highlight color. Bright, cheerful, high-energy.
    *   Use: Secondary buttons, badges, logo backgrounds, footer background, alternate section backgrounds.

*   **Muted (Soft Violet)**: `#C4B5FD`
    *   Tertiary color for depth and variation without clashing.
    *   Use: Subtle backgrounds (`bg-neo-muted`), card headers, FAQ answer backgrounds, decorative elements.

*   **White**: `#FFFFFF`
    *   Used for high-contrast text on dark backgrounds (e.g., black sections, accent buttons).
    *   Use: Text on black backgrounds, inverted buttons, contrast panels.

**Color Usage Rules:**
- **Never use subtle grays.** It's black or a color, never #333 or #666.
- **High contrast is mandatory.** All text must pass WCAG AA on its background.
- **Color blocking:** Sections alternate between cream, secondary, muted, and black to create visual rhythm.

### Typography
*   **Family**: `Space Grotesk` (Google Font: `font-family: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif`)
    *   A geometric sans-serif with quirky personality. Modern but not clinical. Bold enough to carry heavy weights.
    *   Load via Google Fonts: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@400;500;700;900&display=block`

*   **Weights**: **Only heavy weights allowed.**
    *   **Black (900)**: For all headings (h1, h2, h3). `font-black`
    *   **Bold (700)**: For all body text, labels, buttons. `font-bold`
    *   **Medium (500)**: Sparingly, only for subtle emphasis. `font-medium`
    *   **Regular (400)**: Generally avoided. Lightness is forbidden in neo-brutalism.

*   **Scale**:
    *   Display: `text-8xl` to `text-9xl` (96px to 128px) for hero headlines.
    *   Heading 2: `text-6xl` to `text-8xl` (60px to 96px) for section titles.
    *   Heading 3: `text-4xl` to `text-5xl` (36px to 48px) for subsections.
    *   Body Large: `text-2xl` to `text-3xl` (24px to 30px) for emphasis.
    *   Body: `text-lg` to `text-xl` (18px to 20px) for readable text.
    *   Small: `text-sm` to `text-base` (14px to 16px) for labels and metadata.

*   **Styling Techniques**:
    *   **Text Stroke (Display)**: Use `-webkit-text-stroke: 2px black` with `color: transparent` for massive hollow outlined text.
    *   **Case**: Heavy use of **UPPERCASE** (`uppercase`) for headings, labels, buttons, and emphasis. Lowercase is acceptable for body text.
    *   **Tracking**:
        *   Headlines: `tracking-tighter` or `tracking-tight` for density.
        *   Labels: `tracking-widest` or `tracking-[0.2em]` for emphasis.
    *   **Line Height**: Tight leading. `leading-none` or `leading-[0.85]` for display. `leading-snug` or `leading-relaxed` for body.

### Radius & Borders
*   **Radius**: **Default is `0px` (sharp, angular corners).**
    *   Exception: `rounded-full` ONLY for pill badges, circular stickers, or decorative shape elements.
    *   Never use `rounded-md` or `rounded-lg`. It's either sharp or fully round.

*   **Borders**: **Mandatory on every visual element.**
    *   Default: `border-4` (4px solid black). This is the signature thickness.
    *   Thin: `border-2` (2px) only for subtle separators or ghost buttons.
    *   Thick: `border-8` (8px) for major section dividers or hero elements.
    *   All borders: `border-black` (solid black, no transparency).

### Shadows & Effects
*   **Hard Shadows (The Signature)**: Offset, solid black shadows with **zero blur** and **zero spread**. Always bottom-right direction.
    *   **Small**: `shadow-[4px_4px_0px_0px_#000]` or `box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px 0px #000`
    *   **Medium**: `shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_#000]` or `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px #000`
    *   **Large**: `shadow-[12px_12px_0px_0px_#000]` or `box-shadow: 12px 12px 0px 0px #000`
    *   **Massive**: `shadow-[16px_16px_0px_0px_#000]` or `shadow-[20px_20px_0px_0px_#fff]` (for elements on black backgrounds)

*   **Text Shadows**: Use for text on colored backgrounds.
    *   `text-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000` or `text-shadow: 6px 6px 0px #000`

*   **Background Patterns & Textures** (Critical for depth):
    *   **Halftone Dots**:
        ```css
        background-image: radial-gradient(#000 1.5px, transparent 1.5px);
        background-size: 20px 20px;
        ```
    *   **Grid Pattern** (graph paper):
        ```css
        background-size: 40px 40px;
        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 1px, transparent 1px),
                          linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 1px, transparent 1px);
        ```
    *   **Noise Texture** (SVG filter):
        ```css
        background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 200 200' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='noiseFilter'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'%2F%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noiseFilter)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
        ```
    *   **Radial Dots** (for backgrounds):
        ```css
        background-image: radial-gradient(circle, #000 2px, transparent 2.5px);
        background-size: 30px 30px;
        ```

## Component Styling Principles

### Buttons
*   **Shape**: Rectangular with sharp corners. Default height: `h-12` to `h-14`. No rounding.
*   **Style**:
    *   Primary: `bg-neo-accent` (red) with `border-4 border-black`.
    *   Secondary: `bg-neo-secondary` (yellow) with `border-4 border-black`.
    *   Outline: `bg-white` with `border-4 border-black`.
    *   Ghost: `border-2 border-transparent` that becomes `border-black` on hover.
*   **Typography**: `font-bold text-sm uppercase tracking-wide` (all caps, bold, spaced).
*   **Shadow**: Hard shadow `shadow-[4px_4px_0px_0px_#000]` or `shadow-[6px_6px_0px_0px_#000]`.
*   **Interaction (Critical)**: **"Push" effect.** On `:active`, translate the button to cover its shadow:
    ```css
    active:translate-x-[2px] active:translate-y-[2px] active:shadow-none
    ```
    This creates a mechanical "click down" feel, like a physical button.
*   **Hover**: Slight background darkening or shadow intensification. Fast transition (`duration-100`).

### Cards / Containers
*   **Structure**: `bg-white` with `border-4 border-black` and sharp corners (`rounded-none`).
*   **Shadow**: Deep hard shadows (`shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_#000]` to `shadow-[12px_12px_0px_0px_#000]`).
*   **Hover (Lift Effect)**: Translate card **upward** and **increase shadow size**:
    ```css
    hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-[10px_10px_0px_0px_#000]
    ```
    or
    ```css
    hover:-translate-y-2 hover:shadow-[16px_16px_0px_0px_#000]
    ```
    This makes the card feel like it's physically lifting off the page.
*   **Headers**: Often have colored backgrounds (`bg-neo-muted/20` or `bg-neo-secondary`) with `border-b-4 border-black` separator.

### Inputs
*   **Style**: Thick black borders (`border-4 border-black`). Sharp corners. `bg-white` default.
*   **Typography**: Large, bold text (`font-bold text-lg` or `text-xl`). Placeholder is `placeholder:text-black/40`.
*   **Focus**: **Background color change** instead of ring:
    ```css
    focus-visible:bg-neo-secondary focus-visible:shadow-[4px_4px_0px_0px_#000] focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-0
    ```
    Input becomes yellow and gains a shadow when focused. No soft glow.
*   **Height**: `h-14` to `h-20` for touch-friendly sizing.

### Navigation
*   **Logo**: Bordered box (`border-4 border-black`) with accent background. Uppercase, black font.
*   **Links**: Bold, uppercase text. Hover state adds border and background:
    ```css
    hover:border-black hover:bg-neo-accent hover:px-2 hover:shadow-[4px_4px_0px_0px_#000]
    ```
*   **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger button as bordered square with shadow. Menu slides in with stacked bordered buttons.

### Badges
*   **Shape**: Pill (`rounded-full`) or square (`border-4`).
*   **Style**: Colored background (`bg-neo-accent` or `bg-neo-secondary`) with thick border and shadow.
*   **Typography**: `font-black text-sm uppercase tracking-widest`.
*   **Usage**: Positioned absolutely over elements (`:absolute top-4 left-4`), rotated (`rotate-3`), or inline.

## Layout Principles

*   **Container Width**: Use `container mx-auto` with `max-w-7xl` or `max-w-6xl` for focused content width.
*   **Spacing**: Dense 8px base grid. Sections have `py-16` to `py-32` vertical padding. Content spacing: `gap-8` to `gap-12`.
*   **Rotation (Sticker Effect)**: Use slight rotations on containers and text blocks to break grid monotony:
    *   `rotate-1` (1 degree), `-rotate-2` (-2 degrees), `rotate-3` (3 degrees).
    *   Apply to headline spans, cards, badges, and CTAs.
*   **Marquee**: Use horizontal scrolling marquees (e.g., `react-fast-marquee`) as:
    *   Trust indicators at page top.
    *   Testimonial carousels.
    *   Section dividers with repeated text.
*   **Overlapping**: Allow elements to overlap using absolute positioning:
    *   Floating decorative shapes (`absolute top-20 left-0`).
    *   Badges positioned on corners of cards (`-top-6 -right-6`).
    *   Background text as texture (`absolute opacity-10 text-9xl`).
*   **Visual Chaos Zones**: Intentionally create "busy" areas (like Hero right side) with:
    *   Stacked geometric shapes.
    *   Multiple rotated badges.
    *   Large background numbers or text.
*   **Asymmetry**: Avoid perfect symmetry. Use 60/40 splits, offset columns, and staggered grids.

## The "Bold Factor" (Non-Genericness)

These techniques ensure the design is unmistakably neo-brutalist and never generic:

1.  **Text Stroke for Display Typography**: Use `-webkit-text-stroke: 2px black` with `color: transparent` for massive hollow outlined headings. Overlay with solid version for depth effect.

2.  **Sticker Layering**: Elements feel like physical stickers:
    *   Rotated text blocks with borders and shadows.
    *   Absolutely positioned badges that overlap content.
    *   Multiple "layers" created with shadows.

3.  **Interactive Physics**: Elements must physically move:
    *   Buttons: **Push down** on click (`active:translate-x-[2px] active:translate-y-[2px]`).
    *   Cards: **Lift up** on hover (`hover:-translate-y-2`).
    *   Badges: **Rotate further** on hover (`hover:rotate-12`).

4.  **Primitive Shape Motifs**: Heavy use of:
    *   **Stars** (5-point, `<Star />` from lucide-react). Use as decorative elements, ratings, and dividers.
    *   **Arrows** (`<ArrowRight />`) for directional cues.
    *   **Basic Shapes**: Squares, circles, rectangles as decorative floaters.

5.  **Thick Border Everywhere**: If an element doesn't have a visible border, it feels wrong. Even whitespace is bordered.

6.  **Color Blocking**: Large sections with solid color backgrounds (red, yellow, violet, black) to create high-contrast rhythm.

7.  **Texture Overlays**: Never leave backgrounds flat. Always add halftone, grid, or noise.

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

These techniques would break the neo-brutalist aesthetic:

*   **Blur Effects**: No `blur()`, no `backdrop-blur`, no soft `box-shadow` with blur radius. All shadows must be hard.
*   **Opacity/Transparency**: Avoid alpha transparency on backgrounds (except for texture overlays at low opacity).
*   **Smooth Gradients**: No `bg-gradient-to-r` fades. Use hard color stops or patterns instead.
*   **Rounded Corners (Mid-Range)**: Avoid `rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`. It's either `rounded-none` (sharp) or `rounded-full` (pill/circle).
*   **Subtle Grays**: No `#333`, `#666`, `#999`. Use pure black or a color.
*   **Soft Animations**: No `ease-in-out` or slow durations. Use `ease-linear` or `ease-out` with fast durations.
*   **Minimalist Whitespace**: Don't leave large empty areas. Fill with texture, patterns, or decorative elements.

## Animation & Motion

*   **Feel**: Bouncy, playful, mechanical, arcade-like.
*   **Transition Speed**: Fast and snappy.
    *   Buttons: `duration-100` (100ms).
    *   Cards/Hovers: `duration-200` or `duration-300` (200-300ms).
*   **Easing**: `ease-linear` for mechanical feel, `ease-out` for natural deceleration. Avoid `ease-in-out`.
*   **Hover Interactions**:
    *   Buttons: Background darken, then press on click.
    *   Cards: Translate upward (`-translate-y-2`) and shadow deepens.
    *   Links: Add border and background, snap into place.
*   **Looping Animations**:
    *   Slow spins on decorative stars (`animate-spin-slow`, custom duration 10s).
    *   Pulsing on call-to-action elements (`animate-pulse`).
    *   Bouncing on attention-grabbing badges (`animate-bounce`).
*   **Custom Animations** (via CSS):
    ```css
    @keyframes spin-slow {
      from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
      to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
    }
    .animate-spin-slow {
      animation: spin-slow 10s linear infinite;
    }
    ```

## Spacing, Layout & Iconography

*   **Max-Width**: `max-w-7xl` or `max-w-6xl` for main content. Sections can be full-width with contained inner content.
*   **Grid System**: Use Tailwind's grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) with responsive breakpoints.
*   **Spacing Scale**: Dense. `gap-6` to `gap-12` between elements. `py-16` to `py-32` for section padding.
*   **Iconography**: Import from `lucide-react`.
    *   Style: `stroke-[3px]` or `stroke-[4px]` for thick, bold strokes.
    *   Size: `h-8 w-8` or larger (`h-12 w-12`) for emphasis.
    *   Placement: Inside bordered boxes (`border-4 border-black bg-neo-accent p-4`).
    *   Fill: Use `fill-black` or `fill-white` for solid icons.

## Responsive Strategy

*   **Mobile First**: Design starts with mobile (`base`) and scales up.
*   **Breakpoints**:
    *   `sm:` (640px) - Small tablets
    *   `md:` (768px) - Tablets
    *   `lg:` (1024px) - Desktops
    *   `xl:` (1280px) - Large desktops
*   **Mobile Adaptations**:
    *   **Typography**: Scale down (e.g., `text-4xl sm:text-6xl md:text-8xl`).
    *   **Spacing**: Reduce padding (e.g., `p-8 sm:p-12 md:p-16`).
    *   **Grids**: Stack to single column (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
    *   **Shadows**: Reduce size on mobile (e.g., `shadow-[6px_6px_0px_0px_#000] sm:shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_#000]`).
    *   **Navigation**: Hamburger menu with bordered button. Full-screen or slide-in drawer.
    *   **Buttons**: Full width on mobile (`w-full sm:w-auto`).
    *   **Touch Targets**: Minimum `h-14` for tappable elements.
*   **Core Aesthetic Maintained**: Even on mobile, keep thick borders, hard shadows, and bold typography. Don't default to "generic mobile" design.

## Accessibility & Best Practices

*   **Contrast**: High contrast is built-in (black on cream, white on black, black on yellow). Ensure all color combinations pass WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
*   **Focus States**: Use thick focus rings:
    ```css
    focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-black focus-visible:ring-offset-2
    ```
    or background color change (yellow) for inputs.
*   **Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
    ```css
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
      .animate-spin-slow, .animate-bounce, .animate-pulse {
        animation: none;
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible. Tab order should be logical.
*   **Screen Readers**: Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`). Add `aria-label` to icon-only buttons.
*   **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px (roughly `h-12` or `h-14` in Tailwind) for all tappable elements on mobile.
