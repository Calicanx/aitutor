I'll use leading questions rather than simply providing the answer, aiming to build a deeper understanding of addition. Sure, I can do that! The question says: \"Mia had 4 horses. She got 1 more horse. Now she has ___ horses.\" To solve this, what do you think we need to do with the numbers 4 and 1? **Summarizing Mia's Horses** I've confirmed that the user's initial math is correct; 4 + 1 does indeed equal 5. I've connected this calculation to the initial problem about Mia's horses. I'm now crafting a concise question to guide the user toward a complete answer, leveraging their existing arithmetic understanding to clarify the final solution. Exactly! So, how many horses does Mia have now?",
