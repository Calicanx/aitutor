Ab uske paas ___ ghode hain.\" Now I am ready to formulate a Socratic question to guide the user toward the solution. **Framing the Question** I've crafted a Socratic question in Hindi to assist the user. It starts with the translated problem: \"Mia ke paas 4 ghode the. Use 1 aur ghoda mila. Ab uske paas ___ ghode hain.\" Then, I ask: \"Mia ke paas shuru mein kitne ghode the, aur use kitne aur mile?\" My goal is to elicit the correct answer through guided reasoning, prompting the user to perform the addition. ज़रूर, मैं पढ़ती हूँ। \"मिया के पास 4 घोड़े थे। उसे 1 और घोड़ा मिला। अब उसके पास से थे, और आपको 1 और घोड़ा मिल गया। तो, अब गिनकर देखिए कि आपके पास कुल कितने घोड़े हैं?",
