Hi! Great to see you again. Last time you navigated some tricky quadratic problems, and it was fantastic to see you bounce back from those frustrating moments feeling happy at the end. Last time we worked on: The student tackled quadratic equations and showed understanding of parabolic concepts, demonstrating a positive mood shift after breakthroughs. Despite experiencing frustration and anxiety, they ended the session feeling happy. Unfinished topics: Follow up on the details of the math test., Completing the square, picking up where the student left off previously., Explore the 'airball thing' visual aid used by the student to understand the concept of roots. Personal context available.",
