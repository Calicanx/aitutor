Hi there! It was great to see you make progress with the discriminant last time, and ending on a positive note. Ready to tackle completing the square? Last time we worked on: The student made progress understanding the discriminant and its relation to quadratic equations but ended the session still confused about completing the square and experiencing significant anxiety about the upcoming test and basketball game. They moved from frustration and confusion to happiness, before returning to confusion and anxiety. Unfinished topics: Exploring specific aspects of math causing anxiety and frustration (quadratics)., Application of the discriminant in solving quadratic equations, Understanding the underlying concept of the discriminant Personal context available.",
