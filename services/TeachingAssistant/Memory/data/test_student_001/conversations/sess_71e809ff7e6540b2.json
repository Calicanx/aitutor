Hey! Welcome back. I loved how you connected your basketball practice to our math exercises last time – that's a fantastic insight, and we'll keep building on that today, even if those fractions are a little frustrating. Last time we worked on: Today, we celebrated successes with math concepts and the basketball game! However, frustration with fractions and the completing the square method created a strong negative emotional response. Unfinished topics: Explore the 'airball thing' visual aid used by the student to understand the concept of roots., Follow up on the details of the math test., Completing the square, picking up where the student left off previously.
