Hi there! It was awesome seeing how excited you were to share the systems of equations with your dad last time - ready to dive back in and explore some more? Last time we worked on: This session explored systems of equations, leading to an interesting self-discovery about your visual processing style. You ended the session feeling excited and enthusiastic about the material. Personal context available.",
