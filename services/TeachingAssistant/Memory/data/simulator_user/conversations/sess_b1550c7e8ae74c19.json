Hi there! Welcome back! It was fantastic seeing you work through those tricky problems last session, and it was even more impressive how you bounced back from those moments of frustration. Last time we worked on: This session explored understanding of quadratic equations, successfully calculating the vertex, and recognizing a learning pattern despite experiencing several emotional challenges. They ended the session feeling happy about their progress. Unfinished topics: math test, completing the square, physics Personal context available.",
