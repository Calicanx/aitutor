Hey there! It was awesome seeing how happy you were with the progress last time, especially when you identified that helpful pattern that really clicked with the vertex! Last time we worked on: Today, we worked through a physics problem, initially navigating feelings of frustration and anxiety, but ultimately finding success and understanding concepts like the vertex. By the end, the student expressed happiness with the progress made. Unfinished topics: Address student's underlying aversion to physics and word problems., Review fundamentals if needed, Solving the equation for landing time. Personal context available.",
