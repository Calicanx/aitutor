Hey! Welcome back – it was great hearing that story you shared last time, and I'm ready to dive in again when you are. Last time we worked on: The student demonstrated understanding of completing the square and the discriminant, but struggled with fractions and expressed frustration and fatigue. The session ended with the student feeling tired. Unfinished topics: Deeper understanding and application of the quadratic formula., How to use the discriminant to determine the nature of roots., Specific problem from homework involving the discriminant.
