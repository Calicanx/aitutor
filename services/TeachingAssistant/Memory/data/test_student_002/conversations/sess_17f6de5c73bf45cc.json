Hi there! Great job expressing your gratitude at the end of our last session – it really meant a lot. We're going to tackle completing the square today, so hopefully, we can build on the progress you made with the discriminant! Last time we worked on: The student made progress understanding quadratic equations, particularly the discriminant, but ended the session confused about the completing the square process. The session was marked by a rollercoaster of emotions, starting with anxiety and ending in confusion. Unfinished topics: Exploring the student's specific challenges with mathematical symbols., Investigating what aspects of textbook explanations are difficult to understand., Quadratics (topic suggested by the AI) Personal context available.",
