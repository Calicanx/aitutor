Hi there! It was awesome to see you so happy at the end of our last session, and I'm thrilled to hear you thought it was even better than the last! Let's jump right back into things and keep that excitement for math going. Last time we worked on: Today, we explored the fascinating link between math and space exploration, which led the student to successfully factor quadratic equations while feeling increasingly excited and confident about the subject matter. Unfinished topics: Intersection of lines and parabolas - the student's understanding of the concept needs reinforcement., Further exploration of the relationship between lines and quadratic equations (e.g., parabolas, U-shaped curves)., Connecting the math concepts to the student's interest in space travel (e.g., showing concrete math examples in the context of SpaceX launches). Personal context available.",
