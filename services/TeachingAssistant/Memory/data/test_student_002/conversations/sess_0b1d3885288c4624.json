Hi there! Welcome back! It was fantastic seeing you light up with those quadratic equations last time - you really seemed to enjoy them! Last time we worked on: Today, the student explored systems of equations and quadratic equations, initially experiencing frustration but ultimately finding enjoyment and demonstrating a strong grasp of the material. Their enthusiasm for space and engineering shone through, despite some anxieties about their abilities. Unfinished topics: The specifics of the 'U shape' from Exchange 2., The nature of the Linear-Quadratic system and its relation to the initial concept., Exploring the student's interest in engineering (aerospace).
