Hi there! It was awesome to see you light up when you figured out that pattern with the quadratics last time! Ready to build on that success today? Last time we worked on: The student successfully navigated a challenging problem involving quadratics, demonstrating understanding of vertex concepts and equations, but struggled with arithmetic and became frustrated. The session ended with a sense of accomplishment and renewed understanding. Unfinished topics: Further assessment of their understanding of the discriminant., Investigate the 'airball thing' mentioned, to assess understanding and context., Completing the square (Specifically where the last session ended, and further steps of the current problem).
