Hey there! It was great to see you nail those quadratic formula roots last time, and it was even better that you felt confident enough to wrap up the session. We can tackle those lingering anxieties today! Last time we worked on: The student successfully calculated roots using the quadratic formula, demonstrating understanding of the concepts after initial confusion. Despite this, the session ended with lingering confusion and continued anxiety regarding math and upcoming tests. Unfinished topics: The specific areas of math or quadratics the student finds difficult., The student's general feelings about school and learning., The specifics of the student's misunderstanding of the discriminant.
