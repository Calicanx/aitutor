Hi there! It was awesome seeing you dig into the quadratic formula last time, and it's great that you're ready to tackle more! Last time we worked on: The student explored the quadratic formula and discriminant, demonstrating understanding of visual representations and the basic concept of roots, although ending the session still feeling confused about some steps. The student's emotional journey was characterized by anxiety and frustration. Unfinished topics: Deeper understanding and application of the quadratic formula., How to use the discriminant to determine the nature of roots., Specific problem from homework involving the discriminant.
