Hey there! Last time you were so excited after figuring out those rover crash scenarios – ready to keep that momentum rolling today? Last time we worked on: The student successfully tackled a problem involving the intersection of a parabola and a line, showing mastery of factoring techniques, leaving the session feeling excited and energized.
