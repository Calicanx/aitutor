Hey there! Great work on getting to the final answer last time, even if things felt a little tricky at the end. Let's tackle those confusing spots in quadratic equations today! Last time we worked on: We explored the student's struggles with quadratic equations, particularly the discriminant, the quadratic formula and related concepts. While there was progress in understanding some concepts, the student ended the session feeling confused. Unfinished topics: Exploring the student's specific challenges with mathematical symbols., Investigating what aspects of textbook explanations are difficult to understand., Quadratics (completing the square) Personal context available.",
