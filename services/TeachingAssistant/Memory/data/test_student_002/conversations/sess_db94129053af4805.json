Hi there! It's great to see you again. I remember you did such a fantastic job nailing part of that equation with Exchange 3 last time – even though it was tiring, that was a real win! Last time we worked on: The student demonstrated understanding of several mathematical concepts, including the discriminant and algebraic manipulation, but experienced frustration and fatigue particularly when dealing with fractions and complex operations. Unfinished topics: Further exploration of the 'airball thing' and its effectiveness as a memory aid., Investigate the student's reaction to the math test in greater detail., Further assessment of student understanding of the discriminant.
