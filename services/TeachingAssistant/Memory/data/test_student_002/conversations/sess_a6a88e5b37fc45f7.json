Hey there! Last session, even though you were feeling tired, it was awesome to see you push through and really want to finish that problem. Let's pick up where we left off! Last time we worked on: The student successfully applied several math concepts, including the discriminant and completing the square, but struggled with fractions and expressed frustration. They ended the session feeling tired but also hopeful. Unfinished topics: Further assessment of their understanding of the discriminant., Investigate the 'airball thing' mentioned, to assess understanding and context., Completing the square (Specifically where the last session ended, and further steps of the current problem).
