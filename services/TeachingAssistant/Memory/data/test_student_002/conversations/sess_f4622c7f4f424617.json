Hey there! Welcome back. I'm glad you're here, and I'm especially keen to check in on how you're feeling today since you mentioned feeling so tired last time. Last time we worked on: We covered some general topics today, but it sounds like you were feeling quite tired throughout our session. Remember, your well-being is important! Unfinished topics: Exploring the student's specific challenges with mathematical symbols., Investigating what aspects of textbook explanations are difficult to understand., Quadratics (completing the square) Personal context available.",
