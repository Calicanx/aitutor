I've broken down the task into completing \"sevens\" and \"4x\". Focusing on the first row, I'll start with the expression `7 + 7 + 7 + 7`. My plan is to ask how many times the number 7 appears, to link this to the \"sevens\" box. This should be a good starting point. Hi Mario! I'm doing great, thanks! It looks like you've got a math problem in front of you. It's asking you to find equivalent expressions. Let's start with the first one: `7 + 7 + 7 + 7`.` How many times is the number 7 being added there?",
