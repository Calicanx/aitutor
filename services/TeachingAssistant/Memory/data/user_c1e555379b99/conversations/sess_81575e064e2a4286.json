My goal is to understand the root of this \"no\" - is it readiness, motivation, or something else entirely? To find the best path forward, I need to convey my empathy and encourage some further explanation of this stance. Ah, gotcha. Sometimes it can feel that way. Is there anything in particular that's making you feel a bit unenthusiastic today? **Checking for Re-engagement** I'm working on re-engaging the student. I'm taking a patient approach, starting by acknowledging their initial reluctance. Now, I'm checking if they're still around. I'll then gently re-offer the opportunity to explore some intriguing problems together, keeping a positive and encouraging tone. Hey, just checking in. Are you still there? And maybe we could try some different kinds of problems today? I think we have some really interesting ones.",
